        <h1>Greetings to the World!</h1>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
        <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Jason, an incoming software engineering student at Flatiron School NYC. I'm super pumped to begin this new chapter and figured I would share a bit about my journey and how I got here. I graduated from Baruch College during the pandemic, in the fall of 2020, with a BBA in Industrial/Organizational Psychology from the Zicklin School of Business. My immediate plan thereafter was to move to the startup nation, Tel Aviv, Israel to complete a 5 month long internship program, however, due to Israel experiencing its THIRD wave of covid the Government imposed another lockdown, closing boarders, and the airport completely, preventing all foreigners from entering the country indefinitely. So, what was originally intended to be a January arrival immediately after my graduation in December, became a deferral to an April arrival. Thankfully, the company I had an internship lined up with stuck with me and allowed me to join them upon my arrival in April. My first real exposure to the tech world was through this internship, working as a Media Buyer for a sports-tech startup called Minute Media. After working there for five months, on a team that included both front-end and back-end developers, I built relationships with my co-workers that I didn't previously anticipate in the slightest. Through these relationships I was able to gain a legitimate glimpse into the work that goes into being a software engineer. After consulting with many of them, along with friends and family, it became evident that joining a bootcamp was a great move to make on both a personal and professional level.</p>
